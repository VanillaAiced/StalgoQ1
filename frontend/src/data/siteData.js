    description: "Midnight Sun Café started as a small idea between friends who loved late-night conversations over good coffee. We wanted a place that felt warm, unhurried, and a little bit magical, somewhere you can recharge, hang out, or get work done without feeling rushed. Every cup we serve is made with care, and every guest who walks in becomes part of the atmosphere that makes our café feel like a quiet escape in the middle of a busy day.",
    mission: "Our mission at Midnight Sun Café is to serve thoughtful, quality coffee in a warm space where people can slow down, connect, and feel at home.",
